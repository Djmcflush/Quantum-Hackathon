# Quantum-Hackathon


A joint collaboration hackathon using IBM Qskit

Idea behind our project is to reproduce the work of https://github.com/nikhilmaram/Show_and_Tell with Quantum Computing. A CNN - LSTM network capable of captioning images with detailed sentences. The portion of the work that we hope to reproduce is the CNN, the LSTM will stay classic combining for a hybrid Quantum-Classical model. We will then compare the results of our project to the orgininal paper.
